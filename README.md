# Surf-s-Up-with-Advanced-Data-Storage-and-Retrieval

The following analysis consists of building a data frame to pull information from available weather sites in Hawaii. W. Avy requires the following information to assess the potential opening of an ice cream shop with surf gear. 

## Overview:
W. Avy is looking for a business opportunity that will require capital, to make the right decision, we have been asked to help develop an analytical report to provide concrete data to help them decide if the business opportunity is viable. Based on location and the weather data collected in the past years, we have been able to put together data frames for our analysis. 

### Resources:
- Software: Jupyter Notebook v6. 5.2, SQLAlchemy
- Resources: hawaii.sqlite, SurfsUp_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb

## Results:
Based on our analysis, these are the 3 primary key points that were found for the months of June and December. 

### Summary Statistics for December:
- The average temperature in December was lower than in the month of June, with a 71 degrees (°F)
- We have more data points in December, a total of 1517 data points were collected.
- there is a difference of 8 °F in the lowest temperature recorded in December. The lowest temperature recorded in the month of December was 56 °F while in June the lowest temperature reached 64 °F. 

Overall, the ice cream shop looks like it would be reasonable judging the weather conditions, although, we can expect a few days of the month where sales could be impacted by the low temperatures.

### Summary Statistics for June:
- The month of June is on average ~5 °F warmer than the month of December, overall the high temperatures seem to be reasonable for a nice warm vacation. Not too hot, but not too cold. 
- There is more data collected in the month of June, with a total of 1700 data points collected during the month. This indicates that we have more accurate data for June. 
- The hottest temperature recorded in June reached 85 °F, which is only 2 °F warmer than in December. 

Overall we can conclude that June is a perfect month to eat ice cream, warm enough to enjoy ice cream throughout the entire month.

## Summary:
In summary, the temperatures in Hawaii remain relatively the same all year round, and the chances of a big drastic fluctuation of temperature are minimal judging by the standard deviation provided in both months of the year. W. avy should persue the business oppportunity presented in Hawaii to open an icecream shop with surfing gear, overall the weather in the Island will help their business thrive.
